# BetaDev

This is a group that is a bit Work in progress, but hopefully this will be part of BETA that can help develop the BETA website and / or other projects. If you are interested in helping to maintain and develop the website and other projects for beta, contact the board(Styret) at our [Discord](https://discord.gg/UQCPkZD)
