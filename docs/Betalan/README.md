## What is Betalan

Betalan is a LAN party where competitions are held in various computer games. It is also a social arena where different students can meet and simply relax from studies and other everyday problems. BetaLAN is a subsidiary organization of Beta with its own board, consisting of the BetaLAN Leader, Beta's deputy leader. BetaLAN is primarily open to all students at UiA and is completely alcohol-free! Betalan aims to organize a LAN once per semester. The LAN has a maximum limit of 100 people, so remember to get your tickets quickly.

# BetaLAN crew

BetaLAN is nothing without its awesome Crew Members. The number of crew members varies from year to year, but it has usually been between 7 to 10 people, excluding the board. To join the crew, you can show up to one of our weekly meetings (check with BetaLAN leader in the discord when this is).

# Competitions

There have usually been several competitions in games suggested by the participants. For more information about this, check the forum. Some classics have been StepmaniaX and Fall Guys.
