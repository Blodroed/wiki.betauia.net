# CTF

In computer security, Capture the Flag (CTF), a type of wargame, is a computer security competition. CTF contests are usually designed to serve as an educational exercise to give participants experience in securing a machine, as well as conducting and reacting to the sort of attacks found in the real world (i.e., bug bounty programs in professional settings). Reverse-engineering, network sniffing, protocol analysis, system administration, programming, and cryptanalysis are all skills which have been required by prior CTF contests at DEF CON. There are three main styles of capture the flag competitions: attack/defense, hardware challenges and Jeopardy!.


In an attack/defense style competition, each team is given a machine (or a small network) to defend on an isolated network. Teams are scored on both their success in defending their assigned machine and on their success in attacking the other team's machines. Depending on the nature of the particular CTF game, teams may either be attempting to take an opponent's flag from their machine or teams may be attempting to plant their own flag on their opponent's machine. Two of the more prominent attack/defense CTF's are held every year at DEF CON, the largest hacker conference, and the NYU-CSAW (Cyber Security Awareness Week), the largest student cyber-security contest.


Hardware challenges usually involve getting a unknown piece of hardware and having to figure out how to bypass part of the security, e.g. using debugging ports or using a Side-channel attack.


Jeopardy!-style competitions usually involve multiple categories of problems, each of which contains a variety of questions of different point values and difficulties. Teams attempt to earn the most points in the competition's time frame (for example 24 hours), but do not directly attack each other. Rather than a race, this style of game play encourages taking time to approach challenges and prioritizes quantity of correct submissions over the timing.


There is a fourth type of CTF, most commonly referred to as King of the Hill (KotH). King of the Hill is similar to Attack/Defend, but instead of everyone having their own machine (or small network) to defend, there are only preconfigured ones, which require all teams to exploit them. Once your team has successfully taken over the machine, the focus shifts to defending the machine from other teams attacks. Score is usually determined by a score reporting service on the machine, that reports a team token. When one team is able to gain access, they will remove the other teams token, and insert their own, thus making them the King of the Hill.
