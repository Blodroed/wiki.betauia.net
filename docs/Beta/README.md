# History

Beta Engineering & Technology Association is the student association for students studying Computer Engineering at the University of Agder. In total, there are about 350 students who are members of Beta. Beta was founded in 2006 when it was still called "Høgskolen i Agder", and then, during the move in 2010, Beta followed into the University of Agder. Beta has had a long tradition of improving the social opportunities around the study for students. Beta has, among other things, organized BetaLAN and Retro Night, which are open to all students, and organized company presentations that have helped students into the workforce. Since its inception, Beta has been under STA (The Student Organization in Agder), but it was not until 2014 that Beta was first registered in the Brønnøysund Register as a voluntary organization under STA.
